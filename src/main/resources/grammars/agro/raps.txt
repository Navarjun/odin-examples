South India, Tamil Nadu:
There will be a small increase in crop diversity due to the need to combat the climate and market risks as both of these might become more volatile in the future. Water quality and water availability for agriculture will decrease due to pollution of water bodies, and competition for water from other sources, but water-use efficiency in agriculture will increase due to technological progress. Soil quality will decline by a small-to-medium extent, due to pollution, and intensive cultivation will be caused by a shrinking land base for agriculture. Most subsidies are likely to decline while prices of agricultural commodities will increase. Farm size and wage rates will increase. Mechanization and energy-use intensity in agriculture will increase. Share of agriculture in overall economy will decrease with increase in inequality. Significant decline in poverty will be associated with a decrease in family size and increase in non-farm income. There will not be significant changes in food imports, while yield of important crops will increase due to technological progress in agriculture. Fertilizer-use intensity and fertilizer productivity will increase. Corporate role in agriculture will increase with improved increase in commodity groups.

Sri Lanka, Kurunegala:
The government aims to invest more in agriculture, shortage of labor with the consequence of decreased population growth and household size. The government promotes improved cultivar and climate-smart technologies but the policy to cut down the use of inorganic fertilizer and phase out the fertilizer subsidy results in deteriorating biophysical conditions, low use of inorganic fertilizer, less water, reduced farm sizes which lead to low benefit from the improved cultivar.
